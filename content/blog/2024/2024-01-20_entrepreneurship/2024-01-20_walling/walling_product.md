## How much energy should you pour into it?

* A brilliant product with no market or execution __is dead__
* A mediocre product with __brilliant marketing and execution__ will make you money
* Once you know you have a market and can execute, then you can improve your product
* __Hiring out construction__ of your product is a viable option
* Your path to version 1.0 should fall __between 200 and 400 hours__
* If you’re over 400 hours, take a serious look at eliminating functionality to shorten your time to launch
* Sales website, documentation, marketing, and __everything else will be 100-200 hours__
* Ask yourself if you have confidence in your product idea and in your ability to market it

## Consider Outsourcing Construction

* If you’re coding in your spare time, it will be a stretch to get 15 hours of productive work in per week
* At 15 hours per week, 300 hours means 20 weeks of your free time, or 4.5 months
  * At 550 hours you’re looking at 8.5 months
* Building your own application is more likely to lead to burnout and an early decision to quit
  * If you have a few thousand dollars set aside, you should __consider hiring out development__
* Stepping away from the code will increase your chance of launching
* The advantage of hiring out is it gives you time to:
  * Write copy, write documentation, focus on SEO
  * Set up PPC advertising, hook up payment processing, etc.
* If you have some basic project management skills and can scrape $7k together, you can:
  * save yourself a few hundred hours of coding,
  * get to market faster, and...
  * focus more time on marketing

## Pricing

(Please remember that Walling's book was released in 2010)

* For products that aren’t going to make or save someone money,
  * You’re going to have a tough time charging more than $29 once
  * ...or $14/month
* For consumer products that _will_ make or save someone money,
  * You’re going to top out around $49 flat, or $19/month
* For small businesses, you’re going to top out around $400 or $99/month
  * ...unless you solve a serious pain
* Get a sense of your market and of the price it will bear
* Find out how software is typically purchased by your buyers,
  * ...how they will pay for it, and
  * ...how much they can purchase without approval
* Compare to similar markets
* Lean towards higher pricing. Developers tend to undervalue their software
* __Use three tiers__
  * Multiply by 2 for your middle tier
  * Multiply your middle tier by 2 for the top tier
  * Make each of your three prices (the dollar column) end in a 7, 8 or 9 and be sure they all end with the same number
  * Ensure that as your price doubles from tier to tier,
    * ...you provide more than double the benefit
* Don’t be confident in your numbers until you’ve tested them
* You should test your pricing to determine how far you can push it
* If your sales cycle is less than 1 week, change your pricing without notifying anyone
  * Leave it running for 1-2 weeks, and compare your results

## Markets/Models

* Advantage of marketplaces:
  * High likelihood that users will accidentally discover your application
* There is still a thriving need for desktop applications in several areas
* Plugging functionality holes in the application of a major vendor will eventually backfire should the vendor incorporate your functionality into the main application
