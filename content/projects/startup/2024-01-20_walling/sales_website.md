## What's it meant to accomplish?

### The Sales Funnel

* Most people surfing the web will never see your URL...
  * Most people who see your URL will not click on it...
    * Most people who click on it will not be interested in your site long enough to become a prospect...
      * Most prospects will not buy your product.

Therefore, you will spend time...

* ...making sure more people see your URL
  * Getting written up in blogs
  * Testing and increasing advertising that works
  * Monitoring forums and offering your product as a solution
  * Etc
* ...turning browsers into prospects:
  * Engage them with your content
  * Convince them that they stand to gain by __providing you with their email address__
* ...nurturing an ongoing relationship with your prospects:
  * To turn more of them into buyers
  * Honing your website sales pitch to increase your sales conversion rate

### Improving Conversion > Getting More Traffic

* To increase sales by 10% each month, either:
  * Generate 100 more visitors to your website
  * Increase your conversion rate by 0.1%
* Your number one goal....is turning browsers into prospects
  * A prospect is someone who has expressed at least a small amount of interest in your product
  * On the web....ask someone to provide their email address
  * Convincing someone to give you their email is easier than convincing them to buy your product
  * Once you have an email, you have the chance to begin building a relationship with the customer
  * As well as to gently remind them, through relevant emails, to return to your website
* Offering something in exchange for an email address is guaranteed to work better than offering nothing
  * The best rewards are:
    * A contest
    * A relevant 4-5 day email course
    * A relevant white paper
    * A webinar
* Your mailing list is crucial to your success

### Know Your Customer

* Understand what your ideal customer wants to find:
  * On your website,
  * In your product,
  * What triggers will make them buy
* (Ask yourself) How should you introduce your product to your customer?
* What should your copy say on the first page they see?
* What is going to convince them to provide you with their email address?
* What is going to convince them to purchase your product?
* What keeps your customers awake at night?
* What are they afraid of?
* What are they angry about?
* What are their top three daily frustrations?
* What do they desire most?
* Is there a built-in bias to the way they make decisions? (Example: engineers are exceptionally analytical)
* Do they have their own jargon?
* Who else has tried to sell them something similar?
  * How have they failed or succeeded?

### Calls to Action Only

* In a successful sales website,
  * Every page has a single, primary call to action (that you want your user to take)
  * Any page they land on should include a prominent call to enter their email address
  * Perhaps a secondary call to purchase your product (or learn more about it)
* Every page needs a call to action
  * A visitor may first interact with your website through your Tour, Testimonials, or Pricing page
  * All of them should urge the user to take an action that gets them closer to providing you with their email, trying your demo, or making a purchase
* Eliminate extraneous functionality and duplicate information
* Make buttons look like buttons. Make your buttons so clickable that people can’t help but click them
* No One Reads. Text is a terrible selling tool
  * Audio, video and images are always better

### Core Pages

* The Core Pages:
  * Home
  * Tour
  * Testimonials
  * Contact Us
  * Pricing & Purchase

* The #1 goal of your home page is to convince your visitors to click 1 link
* The key metric with home pages is abandonment rate
  * (The number of people who leave without clicking a link)
* The solution:
  * A simple home page with very few options, and large, clickable buttons
* If you choose to have an image for your home page,
  * ....choose one that shows the result of your product
  * A home loan website should show people living in a house
  * A backpacking website should show people on top of a mountain

### Your Hook

* Your __hook__ is your four-second sales pitch and it should be the headline of your home page
  * 5-7 word summaries of your product
  * When it launched, the iPod’s hook was “One Thousand Songs in Your Pocket”
  * Each one conveys an image in your mind
  * Each one describes what the product does and (in most cases) who it’s made for

* Hook ideas:
  1. Explain what your product does and for whom
      * Such as “Simple proposal software made for designers.”
  2. Make a promise to the customer espousing a benefit of your product
      * Such as “Save Time. Get Paid Faster.”
  3. Describe the single most remarkable feature of your product

* Spend a few minutes brainstorming your hook
* Discuss it with a friend or colleague in your target market
* Once you’ve decided on a hook, put it as the header on your home page
* Consider using it as your tagline
  * Allows you to tell someone in 3 seconds what your product does

### What Else to Include

* Include medium-sized screen shots of the major screens filled with data
* Include a one-minute screencast (video demo) of each page
* __Do not launch__ without testimonials
* You will have beta testers, friends and colleagues who try your software
  * Get a handful of testimonials and create this page
* Monitor mentions of your product using Google Alerts
  * Add choice quotes and backlinks to this page
  * Include any relevant logos to break up the page
  * Shows people that you will link to them if they write about your product
* Provide both a contact form in the browser and a separate email address
* Always provide a toll-free number, even if you let it go to voice mail and return the calls
* There is a great service called "Earth Class Mail"
  * Allows you to pay around $20/ month for a P.O. Box in a number of major U.S. cities
  * They scan the first page and you receive an email notification
  * You can visit their site and tell them to shred it, forward it, or archive it

### Pricing & Sign-up

* Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise,
  * Put this as the link on the far right of your top navigation
  * Add subtle highlighting either by bolding the text or changing the color
* No small text on pricing page – no paragraphs of description. Only large fonts
* A call out to a 30-day free trial in large text
* The pricing plans are shown with minimal description and in large fonts
* One plan is highlighted as the best deal. It really makes you want to click it
* Logos are shown just below the offerings
* If you have add-on modules or services offer them here
* If you have nothing else, allow customers to buy an extra year of support at a discount...
  * or purchase priority support for an additional cost
* If you don’t offer a free trial, then at least offer a 30-day, no questions asked, money back guarantee
  * It may sound like crazy talk to do this with something like software, but...
  * people will purchase the product because of this guarantee

### Email Marketing

* Email is the most pervasive online communication tool
* Email has real potential to create substantial long-term value as you build your list over time
* Never email someone without their permission
* Only send relevant emails to a small group of people who signed up
* Every email you send will include an unsubscribe link
* Never sell or rent out your email list. To do so would destroy the trust of your list
* Targeted means the subscribers are interested in the laser-focused niche you’ve chosen
* If you sell beach towels, offer a free report on the Top 10 Expert Tips for Saving Money on your Beach Trip (an actual report I gave away on JustBeachTowels.com)
* I recommend shooting for a PDF report from 5-15 pages
* The key is finding a topic that your audience will not only be interested in, but will be ravenous for
* If you target a niche with a common interest....providing ongoing content every 2-4 weeks is the best way to build a relationship
* Think of your mailing list as a blog with a new post every 2-4 weeks
* To gain SEO benefit from your newsletter content, you should also post it to your blog
* Use an autoresponder series, which is...
  * A series of emails sent in a specific order to new subscribers with pre-determined gaps between each email
* Start your mailing list not by sending broadcast emails every 2-4 weeks, but...
  * ....by building your autoresponder series with a 2-4 week gap between each email
* The key is to be relevant. Maintaining high relevance is critical to keeping people subscribed
* Monitor the following news sources and report to your audience on new happenings in their niche:
  * Google Alerts
  * The popular blogs in this niche
* Time of day and day of the week you send your email will have a major impact on how many people open it
* Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are the best days, between 7am and 10:30am
* Write engaging subject lines in 7 words or less
  * The shorter the better
  * Ask a question in your subject and answer it in the emails
  * Use the recipient’s first name in the subject line
* Have One Goal for Each Email
  * Is this a relationship-building email filled with information?
  * Or do you have a call to action for it?
* Every fourth or fifth email can contain a more sales-y message
* Six months before your launch date, use your audience ....to send traffic to your startup’s home page
* Offer them a deal if they provide their email address to be notified of the launch
* Create buzz around your product by:
  * Guest blogging
  * Sending interesting updates to your social networks
  * Commenting on blogs and forums
  * Generally engaging your target audience
  * Always sending them to your home page
* One week before launch (preferably on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday):
  * Email your list of targeted email addresses
  * Let them know that your product will be launching next week and...
  * Since they are on your mailing list, they will receive a special price
* On launch day, email your list. Almost immediately, sales will start rolling in
* Thirty Six Hours After Launch:
  * Send your list a final email informing them that the deal will end in 12 hours
  * You will receive another few sales before you close down your special pricing
