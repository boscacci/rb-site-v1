## What's the biggest startup pitfall?

* Make sure people want what you’re building __before you build it__
* Building something no one wants is the most common source of failure for entrepreneurs
* __Marketing is more important than your product__
* Your product has to be good. If it’s not, you’ll be out of business
* Without a market, a software application is _just a project_
* A product is a project that __people will pay money__ for. In other words, it’s a project that __has a market__
* Create a website that converts visitors into customers
* Writing code, where most of us are well-versed, is only about 30% of the work
* If you are the typical developer, you will not have enough money, power or fame to generate demand for a product people don’t need
* Market Comes First, Marketing Second, Aesthetic Third, and Functionality a Distant Fourth
* In the same market, the product with better marketing wins...every time
* In the same market with equal marketing, the product with the better design aesthetic wins
* Functionality, code quality, and documentation are all a distant fourth
* Marketing is about math and human behavior. The math part is straight-forward
* Even the foremost marketing experts in the world are not sure whether people will buy a new product

You have to take your best guess; then measure and tweak. And then do it 20 more times until you succeed
