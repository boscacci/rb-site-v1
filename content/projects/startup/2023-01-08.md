If you plan to walk a long road, it's best to start with why.

## __Why__ I'm Aiming for $500 MRR by 2025

Why have I set this arbitrary dollar goal for an arbitrary date?

Mostly for the allure of __time freedom__. Financial freedom sounds great too.

- $500 MRR doesn’t sound like much, but it’s infinitely more than zero. Hard, reusable lessons will be learned along the way.
- Corporate America isn’t kind to new parents. We plan to have children around 2027. I plan to make myself available.
- We want to own a home someday, but also want to stay connected to NYC. This will require capital that I don’t have.
- Pouring my daily energy into my venture will be more fulfilling than maximizing shareholder value for another BigCorp.

## Micro SaaS Update
