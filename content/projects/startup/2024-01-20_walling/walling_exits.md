## Grow it or Start Over?

* The option to automate your startup tends to be the best approach
* You spent months building your application and bringing it to market
  * If it’s profitable and you spend no time on it, why sell?
* Once automation is in place it’s almost as if the first product falls off your radar and you are freed up to start another
  * You can do this without selling or closing it down
* By having a product portfolio you diversify your income, and thus diversify your risk
* Knowing you can....move on to another idea in 6 months....once you get it automated frees you up to take more risks
* I find it more interesting on a day to day basis to work on multiple products
* Only when you begin to feel like you have a lot of free time while your first product continues to generate revenue...
  * ....should you consider making the move to Serial Micropreneurship
* Three areas that will require ongoing maintenance:
  * Support
  * New Features
  * Marketing
* Every time you receive a support request, your first thought should be “how can I make sure I never receive this question again?”
* It’s likely you will be able to hire domestic to handle your front-line email support
  * You will pay more for someone in your own country, but they will be fluent in your language and better able to provide higher-quality support
* Once you’ve found keywords that convert and ads that work,
  * ....you only have to adjust as your competition changes
* If you monitor your traffic using Google Analytics and compare month over month...
  * ....you’ll notice when there’s a decline for a specific keyword and you can investigate
* If automation doesn’t work out, selling your product is a good fall-back plan
  * You’re not going to get as much as you feel that it’s worth
  * Valuations are based on multiples of profit
  * A website or domain name typically sells for between 6 and 24 months of net profit
  * The other factor....is how much time is required each month to maintain your product

* Key metrics you should track:
  * Traffic Stats – I recommend using Google Analytics
  * Revenue and Expenses
  * Monitor Your Domain and Business Names using Google Alerts
  * Track every minute you spend working on your product, broken down into development, support and marketing
* Don’t use open source or third-party code that could raise licensing issues down the line
* If you decide to sell your product, your best bet is your professional network
  * Your first option should be to email colleagues and float it to your LinkedIn connections
  * Mention the following:
    * Your Price Range
    * Non-Disclosure Requirement
* Prepare Your Sales Kit:
  * Detailed summary of product in PDF:
    * Product Overview
    * Customers
    * Technical details
    * Positive reviews and high-profile links
    * Revenue
    * Expenses
    * Partnerships
    * Personnel
    * Competition
    * Website traffic
    * Assets included in the sale
    * Price range
    * Future plans (surely you will have a list a mile long)
    * Non-compete – Mention whether you are willing to sign a non-compete in this space
* Escrow.com facilitates the exchange of your product once funds are deposited in an escrow account
* The eBay of website and software sales is Flippa
