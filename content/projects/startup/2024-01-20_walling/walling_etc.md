## Any other notes?

### Walling on Customer Support

* __Support is Brutal__
  * If you’ve built your software right the majority of the issues will not be problems with your product, but degraded OS installations, crazy configurations, a customer who doesn’t know how to double-click, etc
  * The support burden actually worsens with time because your customer base grows
* Anything is much easier the second time. And the third
* Answers need to stem from your long-term desires for your startup and yourself

### Walling on Writing Stuff Down

* Writing down important ideas is critical to building a list of ways to improve your business. With a notebook in hand, you’ll find yourself having amazing insights while in line at the post office
  * Capture keyword ideas, product ideas, niche ideas, to-do’s,
* Documenting repeatable processes for anything you will do more than once is essential to your sanity
* Without process it’s impossible to delegate, difficult to bring on a business partner, and easy to make mistakes
* With processes in place it’s much easier to sell your product if/ when you want to make an exit
* Creating processes will bring you freedom through the ability to easily automate and outsource tasks
* Nearly everything about a startup requires ongoing effort. You have to invest time every month into marketing, development, support, SEO, AdWords, and every other aspect of your business
