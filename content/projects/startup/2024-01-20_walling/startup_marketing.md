## Ok, so marketing is crucial. How's it done economically?

* Core strategies like building an audience, search engine optimization and participating in niche communities have far more impact on your bottom line than most of the new media tools
* Many approaches will not work in your market. For example: using Twitter to market to pool cleaners is not going to yield great results
* Much like building good software requires an understanding of your users,
  * Gaining an understanding of your marketing is your first step to building a successful business
* High quality traffic means each visitor is very close to your ideal customer and they know and trust you
  * TechCrunch traffic is not profitable for startups, unless your niche market is other startups
* While it’s nice to have several thousand people visit your website...
  * if they don’t convert, they may as well have not shown up at all

### Top Shelf Traffic Strategies

1. A Mailing List
2. A Blog, Podcast or Video Blog
3. Organic Search (SEO)

### Second Shelf

4. Social Media / Social Networks
5. Pay-per-click Advertising
6. Forums
7. Press Releases
8. Guest Blogging
9. Affiliate Programs
10. Banner and other advertising
11. Everything else…

### Marketing Toolkit

* Search engine optimization (SEO) is a must
* At a minimum you should create a keyword list and perform on-page SEO
  * Next step, focus on link building strategies to raise your organic search rankings
* Some build entire businesses on pay-per-click (PPC) advertising
  * It’s not something I recommend as a long-term approach
  * Use it for finding keywords that convert for you
    * Spend the time and money to search engine optimize for those terms
  * Pouring a never-ending supply of money into Google AdWords is no way to build a business
* A mailing list is the most effective marketing tool you will possess. It works in any market
* Getting people to engage with you, to listen to and trust you will have more impact on sales than any other marketing approach
* For every person like yourself looking to gain the audience of a market so you can promote your software...
  * ....there is someone with insider knowledge looking to be recognized as an expert in that same market
* Blogs offer twice the marketing punch by catering to both your audience and the search engines
* If you spend a year or two:
  * Writing engaging, original posts,
  * submitting them to social media sites, and...
  * prominently displaying your RSS and email subscription icons,
  * you will gradually build an audience of readers who learn to know and trust you

* Optimize your blog for search engines
* Tweak your posts to target specific search keywords
* Google views a website with constantly updating content as alive and relevant, and it will rank higher
* Google likes large quantities of content and blogs tend toward that direction
* Google likes individual pages that focus on a theme
  * Blogs are ideal for this since every new post is its own page
* Google likes straightforward link structures

### SEO is Actually Super Powerful

* SEO is only two components: on-page factors and incoming links
  * Your page titles, Meta tags, URL structures, and even your domain name
  * Do not get caught up in the apparent complexity or mystery surrounding SEO
  * Implement your on-page SEO and move on
* Incoming links are the currency of the internet
  * The more links you receive from relevant, authoritative websites...
    * ....the more authority Google will grant your site
  * A link implies trust and credibility
  * Link building is the “hard” part of SEO
* The ideal link would come from a page with a high PageRank and few outgoing links
* The website should be extremely relevant to the topic of your site
* Focus 50% of your links on your most important term for that page...
  * ....and the other 50% spread across the other 3-5 terms that page is targeting
* Receiving a big chunk of links at once is only helpful if you continue to build links at a steady pace each month
* [DMOZ](https://www.dmoz.org) – Free. Still worth submitting to
* [JoeAnt](https://www.joeant.com) – $ 40

* Many directory submissions are free
  * Choose your link text wisely and submit to each one by hand
* Websites that link to your competition will more than likely have an interest in linking to you
* Email the linking site’s owner and ask for your site to be added to the list
* Create an alert for all variations of your product names,
  * company names,
  * competitors’ names,
  * and your name,
  * as well as quoted terms with high relevance to your product
* If someone is talking about a problem that you can solve,
  * ....make an intelligent comment or contribution and include a link to your product
* Article marketing is an under-utilized startup marketing tool
  * Submit unique, focused niche articles that link back to your website
    * ....using specific link text to help your SEO
    * Depending on the subject, hire someone to write them for you
* For articles, 500-700 words is best
* Offer a Free Academic/ Non-profit Version of Your Product in Exchange for a Link
* Contact companies whose products you use and...
  * ....offer to provide a testimonial if they will include a link to your website
