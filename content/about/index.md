I'm a data engineer and [author](/book) ðŸ“š who used to work in [film](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574526/) ðŸŽ¬

[_The Spring of Sight_](/book) is my debut nonfiction book. It's a tech ethics read for lay-people about computer vision and society. Grab a copy for [99Â¢ on the kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Sight-Inflection-Computer-Society-ebook/dp/B0C5NBXFRJ)!

[My day job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rboscacci/) is currently "Senior Data Mining Engineer" at Angi dot com (FKA "Angie's List"). It involves programming _cloud computers_ to scrape and clean web data, mostly with Python and NodeJS. [Angi is hiring](https://www.angi.com/careers), so reach out if you see a role that calls to you!

I grew up in Silicon Valley, and it shows. Now I live with my fiancÃ©e in Brooklyn, NY.
