["Start Small, Stay Small"](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching-ebook/dp/B003YH9MMI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525801112&sr=8-1&keywords=start+small+stay+small) is a 2010 book by [Rob Walling](https://robwalling.com/). To me it reads like _The 4-Hour Workweek_ meets _The Lean Startup_. While it's ancient history by tech standards at 14 years old in 2024, I still found it insightful, compact, and encouraging, so I thought I'd share my re-organized kindle notes here.
